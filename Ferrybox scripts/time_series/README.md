This Rscript plots a simple timeseries plot with date on x-axis and value measurements on y-axis for the specified parameter (only one input is possible). **Before** runing this script, ferrybox data must be extracted using the "netcdf_extract_save_fb.R" script.  
The output of this script is a point plot within the extracted time period and boundary area.
